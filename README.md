# Java Exercises
Learning Java programming language. Practice with decision structures, loops and files, abstract data types, methods, classes and objects. Also explored elementary data structures and algorithms like arrays and the ArrayList class, linked lists, stacks and queues, binary trees, recursion, sorting and searching algorithms, and algorithm analysis. All lab assignments were completed in teams of two; my lab partner and me.
